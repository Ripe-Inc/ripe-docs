# Managing Your Project

There are a few properties in a project that you can define

Property|Description
-|-
Values hidden by default|This property ensures that all your values are hidden when opening a key. *Note: This does not prevent users from seeing values, it prevents values from being immediately visible*
Show Value Column|This property shows the **Value** column in the main tree
Show Type Column|This property shows the **Value Type** column in the main tree
Require Reviewer|This property requires all promotions to have a reviewer **whom is not the original creator of the promotion**.
Limit Member Access|This property enables a dialog to `allow` or `deny` access to the project on a user by user basis. Users who are set to `deny` cannot see anything about a project, including keys, regardless of their role.
Manage Applications|This menu allows you to create API applications to perform automated automations such as integrate with Github Actions workflows, or to use the Ripe CLI
