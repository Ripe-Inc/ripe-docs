# Quota

The Quota is how you can see your current subscription plan and how much you've utilized its features. Pay special attention to `Service Calls`, as surpassing this quota will disable access to your team from the service api. If you feel you're getting too close to the quota, but don't feel the need to upgrade your subscription, you can [contact us](https://ripecloud.io/contact.html) and we can give you an estimate for optional addons.

Users with the `Owner`, `Administrator` or `Billing` role can view the Quota through the `Settings -> Manage Team` menu:

Name|Description
-|-
Service Calls|This is the current/maximum number of service and API calls your team can accept per day
Members|This is the maximum number of members your team can have
Projects|This is the maximum number of Projects your team can have
Environments|This is the maximum number of Environments your team can have
Log Retention|This is the maximum number of days that logs are stored for your team. Logs include service and API request logs, and the logs regarding any change to keys, environments, projects, and users.
