Roles in Ripe are used to give more granular access to specific members in your Team. Based on the role a member has, they may or may not be able to perform specific functions in the application.

The following roles can be assigned to members in your team through the `Settings -> Manage Team` menu:

Role Name|Description
-|-
Read Only|This is the default role for members, and allows them to read but not modify and data
Read Write|This role allows members to make key edits and create keys and create promotions
Manager|This role is similar to Read Write, but also allows the member to manage Projects/Environments, as well as approve promotions
Administrator|This role allows members to create Projects/Environments and assign other members different roles
Billing|This role is unique in that its similar to Read Only, but with the added benefit of managing billing subscription details for the team
