# Teams

Teams in Ripe are where your company, organization or department can collaborate on the configuration of the teams' projects.

{: .warning }
A user is allowed 1 free team per account, any additional teams created will work for 24 hours before being disabled unless one of the teams in the free tier is upgraded.

A team has [specific limits](quota) based off of the current subscription, which can be seen by the `Owner`, `Administrator` or `Billing` roles.

You can manage your team in Ripe if your [role access](roles) is either `Owner` or `Administrator`.
