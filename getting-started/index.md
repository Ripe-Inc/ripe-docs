# Quickstart

Welcome to Ripe! Ripe is a platform for unifying configuration of your applications across different environments, enabling your team to accurately manage and maintain 
configuration values across the software development lifecycle.

Let's get you started:

1) **Create a login**: You can [join an existing team](./Joining%20an%20existing%20team), or [create your own](https://app.ripecloud.io)
2) **Create your first Key**: You can follow our in-app quickstart, or if you'd prefer to explore on your own you can read [Creating a Key](./Creating%20a%20key)
3) **Install the Ripe SDK in your application**: Adding Ripe to your application is easy with [one of our SDK's](https://github.com/Ripe-Inc/ripe-sdks), or you can make a [connection manually with an HTTP request](./Connecting%20to%20the%20service).
4) **That's it!**: Watch as your application pulls configuration from Ripe

Next Steps:

* [Managing your Team](Managing%20your%20team)
* [Managing your Project](Managing%20your%20project)
