# Quickstart

Welcome to Ripe! Ripe is a platform for unifying configuration of your applications across different environments, enabling your team to accurately manage and maintain 
configuration values across the software development lifecycle.

Let's get you started:

1. **Create a login**: You can [join an existing team](joining-existing-team), or [create your own](https://app.ripecloud.io)
1. **Create your first Key**: You can follow our in-app quickstart, or if you'd prefer to explore on your own you can read [Creating a Key](creating-a-key)
1. **Install the Ripe SDK in your application**: Adding Ripe to your application is easy with [one of our SDK's](https://github.com/Ripe-Inc/ripe-sdks), or you can make a [connection manually with an HTTP request](connecting-to-a-service).
1. **That's it!**: Watch as your application pulls configuration from Ripe

Next Steps:

* [Anatomy of a Key](anatomy-of-a-key)
* [Managing your Team](managing-your-team)
* [Managing your Project](managing-your-project)
* [Managing your Environment](managing-your-environment)
